I’m trying to compare the conversation I have back at home and the ones I have and observed at Thomas’s home

I felt two major differences. One is that the US’s one talks more about what is happen in the current, like technology, social system, sports, plans and the Chinese one spends more time on the things that have already past / happened long time ago.

Besides, it/s the topic that being discussed is more abstract. It doesn’t have to be so everyday life related. So it is good. I think my family in China is already doing better than a lot of other typical Chinese family. I gave a thought about it and concluded that the reason that I feel the discussion I had in US is better is that people are more aware of the opinions from the both side of those public issues. In china, the news-media regulation and propaganda control is so server that a lot of times you need to tell your friend the opposite’s opinion yourself to continue discussion. In this case, you do can still continue the discussion. But it is really rare that you will be able to learn something new from your friends since they are not as aware of the situation as you do.

Tom (senior one ) recommends me a documentary series for learning American history. Made by XXX adam? Talks about history like Franklin. Maybe I should ask him later.
